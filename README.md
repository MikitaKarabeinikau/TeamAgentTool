# TeamAgentTool

Transform raw ideas into structured product plans, simulate real software-team workflows, and automate planning, testing, and code review — all powered by intelligent agents.

## 📌 Overview

TeamAgentTool is designed to help developers bring ideas to life by simulating a collaborative development team.
You provide an idea; the system converts it into clear business requirements, generates a structured development plan, and produces a complete, prioritized to-do list.

The project supports iterative development: new ideas and features update the plan automatically.
Each agent explains its reasoning, providing transparency and education for new developers learning how real teams operate.
